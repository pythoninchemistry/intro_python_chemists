    "Hopefully the above code is now straightforward to comprehend for anyone with an interest in either the mechanics of the code, or the scientific problem it attempts to solve. It is important to bear in mind that commenting should be used sparingly, and the context should be considered to avoid redundancy. Ultimately, we are trying to convey the function of the code, and not distract from that. Some points in the above text about possible redundancies, and contextual commenting:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The first comment `# calculate scattering angle of an miller plane in an orthorhombic Bravias lattice` is redundant given the context of the code, i.e. in this jupyter book: we have already explained what we are trying to to do, but if this were a stand-alone script, a concise explanation of what the code does - such as this comment - is very helpful. Note this could also come from the name of the script or notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Consider the line ```xray_wavelength = 1.5406 # wavelength of incident radition in Angstroms```. If it read ```xray_wavelength = 1.5406 # wavelength of incident radition``` this would be a redundant comment: the variable name conveys the same message as the comment itself. As scientists, however, it's imperative to convey the units we are working in, and so the addition of 'in Angstroms' confers meaning to the value. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Finally, the comment `the math module works in radians as a default, crystallographers in degrees, and so we need to add an additional step to convert from radians to degrees.` is purely for instructive purposes, most experienced python users would know this: it is not always necessary to include such descriptive commenting.

    "If it weren't for the fact the cell above produces the same ouptut as the cells in the previous section, you may be forgiven for thinking, on first glance, that this reformulation of the code might do something slightly different. This misconception could have been avoided using docstrings, which were breifly discussed in the functions section. We revisit the concept here, to emphasise that even though they are a non-essential part of the function (as shown by the functioning code above), they offer a great deal of clarity. The description of docstrings given in the function section is quoted below:\n",
    "\n",
    "> The docstring is an important (although not essential) component of any function. Describing the purpose of a function is valuable of many reasons, it helps to clarify what the function will do, it offers guidence for others on how to use the function, and it acts to remind future you why it is that you have a particular function and what is does. You may read this last point and roll your eyes, however I promise you that code you write today will not stay present in your memory forever.\n",
    "\n",
    "> In addition to a description of the function, a docstring also typically includes information about the arguments taken by the function and objects that are returned. There are a few common way that these may be formatted, within this book we will use Google Style, however, other styles exist, such as NumPy and Sphinx. Using a standard style of docstring is useful when writting large software packages, due to the availablity of tools to automatically generate software documentation from these docstrings. The Google style indicates the arguments with the keyword Args, before listing the arguments, the expected type and a short description (we find that it can be helpful to include information about the expected units in this section). The Returns keyword is followed by a list of the values returned by the function, since these do not necessary has a name this is omitted.\n",
