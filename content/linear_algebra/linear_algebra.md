# Linear algebra

Linear algebra is branch of mathematics that is still actively researched today. It is the fundamental basis for many chemical applications, for example solving the Schrodinger equation, and is the bedrock of computer science. 

There are multiple linear algebra courses run throughout a mathematics degree, and therefore it is impossible to cover significant proportions of linear algebra in a tutorial such as this. The purpose of this tutorial is to introduce the following key concepts:

- Scalars and vectors
- The dot product of vectors
- Bases
- Matrices
- Notation
- Determinants
- The cross product of vectors
- Inverse transformations
- Active and passive transformations
- Diagonalisation
- Eigenvectors and eigenvalues
- Change of variables

This notebook will not be exhaustive when it comes to the concepts above as our aim is to help facilitate your use of python for chemistry problems. For more information on the above there are a plethora of resources based on undergraduate and postgraduate mathematics courses on the web for a more indepth discussion. 

Whilst many undergraduate chemistry degree courses attempt to steer clear of mathematics as far as possible, we believe that gaining knowledge about these fundamental concepts will not only allow you to become a better programmer, but allow you to tackle the more difficult chemistry problems as well. 

Due to there being a lot of content to cover, and the topics not lending themselves easily to applied chemical problems individually, there will be a longer problem notebook that will test your knowledge of linear algebra after this that will be based on chemical problems.
